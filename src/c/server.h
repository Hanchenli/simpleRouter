 *  NOTE: Students should NOT use any of the data structures of functions
 *        defined in this header file. However, this file describes
 *        a network protocol used by chirouter to obtain the configuration
 *        of the routers it will manage, as well as to send/receive
 *        Ethernet frames (currently to/from a POX OpenFlow controller,
 *        although other controllers could potentially be used). We
 *        encourage you to read the protocol description, as an example
 *        of a protocol designed for this specific purpose. The server.c
 *        file also contains the code used to parse and interpret the
 *        messages in this protocol.

/* The POX controller and chirouter communicate using a simple message-based
 * binary protocol. A single message has the following format:
 *
 *   ------------------------------------------------------      ---
 *  |   Type   |  Subtype  |  Payload Length  |   Payload           |
 *  | (1 byte) |  (1 byte) |    (2 bytes)     |  (N bytes)   ...    |
 *   ------------------------------------------------------      ---
 *
 *  All integers are in network order. Unless otherwise noted, all
 *  integers are unsigned.
 *
 *  The message types are described below. An informal description
 *  of the protocol can be found after the message types.
 *
 *
 *  HELLO (Type = 1)
 *  ================
 *
 *  Subtypes: 1 (From Router) and 2 (To Router)
 *
 *  Payload: None (Payload Length = 0)
 *
 *  Used to perform a simple handshake with the POX controller. When
 *  the POX controller connects to chirouter, it must send a HELLO
 *  message with Subtype = 2 (To Router). chirouter will respond
 *  with a HELLO message with Subtype = 1 (From Router)
 *
 *
 *
 *  ROUTERS (Type = 2)
 *  ==================
 *
 *  Subtype: Always 0 (None)
 *
 *  Payload:
 *
 *   ------------------------
 *  |   Number of Routers   |
 *  |       (1 byte)        |
 *   ------------------------
 *
 *  Payload Length: 1
 *
 *  This message informs chirouter of how many routers it will manage.
 *
 *
 *  ROUTER (Type = 3)
 *  =================
 *
 *  Subtype: Always 0 (None)
 *
 *  Payload:
 *
 *   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  |   Router ID  |  Number of Interfaces  |  Routing Table Length  |       Name         |
 *  |   (1 byte)   |        (1 byte)        |       (1 byte)         |  0 < bytes <= 8 )  |
 *   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  Payload Length: 3 + len(Name)
 *
 *  This message specifies the basic parameters of a single router. It must be followed
 *  by (Number of Interfaces) INTERFACE messages and then by (Routing Table Length)
 *  ROUTING TABLE ENTRY messages.
 *
 *
 *  INTERFACE (Type = 4)
 *  ====================
 *
 *  Subtype: Always 0 (None)
 *
 *  Payload:
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  |   Router ID  |  Interface ID  |  Hardware Address  |  IPv4 Address  |      Name       |
 *  |   (1 byte)   |    (1 byte)    |      (6 bytes)     |    (4 bytes)   | 0 < bytes <= 32 |
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  Payload Length: 12 + len(Name)
 *
 *  This message specifies a single Ethernet interface in the router.
 *
 *
 *  ROUTING TABLE ENTRY (Type = 5)
 *  ==============================
 *
 *  Subtype: Always 0 (None)
 *
 *  Payload:
 *
 *   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  |   Router ID  |  Interface ID  |  Metric   |  Destination Network  |    Mask   |  Gateway  |
 *  |   (1 byte)   |    (1 byte)    | (2 bytes) |      (4 bytes)        | (4 bytes) | (4 bytes) |
 *   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  Payload Length: 16
 *
 *  This message specifies a single entry in the routing table of the given router.
 *  Gateway must be set to 0 for routes that don't have a gateway.
 *
 *
 *  END CONFIG (Type = 6)
 *  =====================
 *
 *  Subtype: Always 0 (None)
 *
 *  Payload: None (Payload Length = 0)
 *
 *  Indicates that all configuration data has been sent. After this point, only
 *  ETHERNET FRAME messages can be sent.
 *
 *
 *  ETHERNET FRAME (Type = 7)
 *  =========================
 *
 *  Subtypes: 1 (From Router) and 2 (To Router)
 *
 *  Payload:
 *
 *   --------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  |   Router ID  |  Interface ID  |  Frame Length  |       Frame       |
 *  |   (1 byte)   |    (1 byte)    |    (2 bytes)   | 0 < bytes <= 1514 |
 *   --------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  Payload Length: 4 + Frame Length
 *
 *  This message is used to transmit an Ethernet frame.
 *
 *  When the Subtype is 1 (From Router), it is used to inform the POX Controller
 *  that the given Ethernet frame must be sent out through the specified
 *  interface (of the specified router)
 *
 *  When the Subtype is 2 (To Router), it used by the POX Controller to inform
 *  chirouter that an Ethernet frame has been received on the specified interface
 *  (of the specified router)
 *
 *
 *  Protocol Description
 *  ====================
 *
 *  The chirouter server has three states: HELLO_WAIT, CONFIG, RUNNING
 *
 *  The server starts in the HELLO_WAIT state. Once it receives a HELLO message from
 *  the POX controller, it sends back a HELLO message and transitions to the CONFIG
 *  state.
 *
 *  The next message from the POX controller must be a ROUTERS message specifying the
 *  number N of routers that chirouter will manage. This must be followed by N router
 *  specifications using the following messages: one ROUTER, one or more INTERFACE
 *  messages, and one or more ROUTING TABLE ENTRY messages.
 *
 *  The router ID numbers must start from zero and be numbered consecutively. For
 *  a given router, the interface ID numbers must start from zero and be numbered
 *  consecutively.
 *
 *  If there are any errors in the configuration data, the server must close the
 *  connection and exit immediately.
 *
 *  After all the configuration data has been sent, the POX controller must send
 *  an END CONFIG message, and the server will transition to the RUNNING state.
 *
 *  In the RUNNING state both the server and the POX controller can send/receive
 *  ETHERNET messages. If the server receives an Ethernet frame with an invalid
 *  Router ID and/or Interface ID, it must log this occurrence and drop that frame.
 *
 *  If the POX controller closes the connection while the server is in the RUNNING
 *  state, the server must reset the chirouter data structures and return to
 *  the HELLO_WAIT state.

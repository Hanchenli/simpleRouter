/*
 *  chirouter - A simple, testable IP router
 *
 *  This header file provides structs and constants to operate on IPv4 headers.
 *
 */

/*
 * This project is based on the Simple Router assignment included in the
 * Mininet project (https://github.com/mininet/mininet/wiki/Simple-Router) which,
 * in turn, is based on a programming assignment developed at Stanford
 * (http://www.scs.stanford.edu/09au-cs144/lab/router.html)
 *
 * While most of the code for chirouter has been written from scratch, some
 * of the original Stanford code is still present in some places and, whenever
 * possible, we have tried to provide the exact attribution for such code.
 * Any omissions are not intentional and will be gladly corrected if
 * you contact us at borja@cs.uchicago.edu
